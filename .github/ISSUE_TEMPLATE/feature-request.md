## ADR Requirement

**Does this require an ADR?**
- [ ] Yes - This is a significant architectural change
- [ ] No - This is a minor feature/addition
- [ ] Unsure - Needs discussion

**If yes, please:**
1. Create an [ADR Proposal](../../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/adr-proposal.md) issue first
2. Link to it from this feature request
3. Wait for ADR acceptance before implementation

**Note:** Features that change core abstractions, introduce new subsystems, or involve security-critical designs require ADRs. See [ADR README](../../docs/adr/README.md) for guidelines.
